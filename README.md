A slightly opinionated starter template for Grasshopper plugin development with a variety of development aids. Most of these are unnecessary, but most are easier to remove than to add.

Most of these features assume you are working on Github, using Visual Studio 2017 or higher, and developer for Rhinoceros 6 or higher.

### Features

- [X] Grasshopper/RhinoCommon bundled with Nuget
  - *Ensures reference paths are maintained across local environments*
- [X] Separate out a `release` folder for non-debug builds
  - *Makes working with Fody and bundling files (e.g. a README) easier*
- [X] A shared class for all component files to inherent
  - *Allows for shared functionality and/or easy implementation of error reporting*
- [X] Linting using FxCop, StyleCop, and a (relatively?) sane set of defaults
- [X] GitHub Pages setup for documentation
  - *See the `docs` folder and the README there*
- [X] Icons Illustrator template with original Grasshopper icons as references
  - *See the `assets` folder*
- [X] CD/CI using GitHub Actions
  - *See the steps in .github/workflows; currently the action will build the application and then upload the gha file from the Release build as an artefact. Build or linting failures will trigger a failed check.*
- [X] 3DM files setup to be stored using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com)
- [X] Cross-compatibility between MacOS and Windows versions of Visual Studio
  - *`GrasshopperBootstrap.csproj` defines split build paths so that each OS will start its own version of Rhinoceros*
- [X] Setup to optionally debug using the WIP versions of Rhinoceros
  - *Use the Debug (WIP) build configuration if this is desirable. You may want to check the file paths in the `csproj` file match your local paths.*
- [X] Code analysis with Codacy and Code Climate
  - *These are not setup per-se; I've just added badges to this README. To use on your projects you will need to [add](https://github.com/marketplace/codacy) [each](https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate) app via the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate)*

### Roadmap (PRs welcome!)

- [ ] Unit tests examples
- [ ] Performance tests examples
- [ ] Fody or ILMerge bundling of reference dlls
- [ ] Example setup for how to use Sentry for error reporting
- [ ] Bash script for easily generating Yak releases
- [ ] Extracting component input/output parmas for doc files?
- [ ] Extracting GHX metadata for doc files?
- [ ] Automate releases to Yak via GitHub actions?

### Setup

This should all work out of the box. See features notes for optional setup steps.

Comments with `GrasshopperBootstrapTODO:` in the code highlight crucial aspects to change in setting up your own plugin.

The default 'spiral' component from the McNeel sample plugin is included for reference and to demonstrate some features.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Andrew Heumann, Matthew Nelson, and Will Pearson for their recommendations.

Unit testing setup is directly based on the approach of Tom Makin, as [demonstrated in this repository](https://github.com/tmakin/RhinoCommonUnitTesting).
